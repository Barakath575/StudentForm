# StudentForm Web App

Hey there! Welcome to my **Student Form Web App** — a tiny, yet powerful HTML project where students meet forms.   

Think of it as your digital student diary… but in form format.  


# What’s Cool About This?
* No fancy backend, just pure HTML magic 
* Lightweight and super simple for anyone to use  
* Great for learning how forms work and practicing HTML  


# How to Use
1. Open the form [here](https://barakath575.github.io/StudentForm/)  
2. Fill in your details (name, age, class… whatever!)
